## Syed A.A. Shah

I am a software engineer, gratuating from Makers Academy in August 2019. I have been indoctrinated in the church of test driven development, Agile process & XP values, but am open to understanding alternative ways of reaching the promised land. Before Makers, I worked in hospitality, genrally in hyphenated roles, as a barista, hospitality assistant and events supervisor. Being the face of plans, sometimes made months in advance, my ability to be forward thinking, calm under pressure and attentive to the sometimes unreasaonable demands of clients was frequently tested and strengthened.

## Skills

#### Test Driven Development(TDD)

#### Quick Learner

During my previous hospitality roles, I have always had to adapt to new work environments & quickly acquire skills. I learnt barista skills through a combination of observation and practice. I also picked up the processes required from hospitality when setting meeting rooms, and providing formal dinner service.

#### Test Driven Development(TDD)

One of the keystone habits, utilising TDD has been especially helpful as a learning tool. It has forced me to think about how to structure code in order to make it testable, to iterate in small steps when approaching a problem & finding the most simple unit to test first.
